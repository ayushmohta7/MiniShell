# Buggy Workflow Engine

This project implements a **minimal configurable workflow engine** (state-machine API) in C# using ASP.NET Core minimal APIs. It allows defining workflows with states and transitions (actions), starting workflow instances, and moving them through allowed transitions.

## üßæ Overview

The workflow engine supports basic state machine operations such as:
- Defining states and actions (transitions)
- Starting workflow instances
- Executing actions to move instances between states

Each action has `fromStates`, a `toState`, and an enabled flag. A workflow must begin with an initial state.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Add and retrieve **workflow definitions**
- Create **workflow instances** from definitions
- Transition workflow instances using defined actions
- In-memory storage (no DB)

‚ö†Ô∏è Some validation and edge cases may not be fully handled yet (e.g., action state mismatches, final-state checks).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quickstart

### Run the server:
```bash
dotnet run
