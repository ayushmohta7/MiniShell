# Shell

This project implements a **Bash-like shell in C++**, offering standard shell functionalities along with additional utilities for malware detection and file deletion under locked conditions. It interacts directly with Linux system interfaces such as `/proc`, enabling process monitoring and control.

## üßæ Introduction

This shell provides a command-line interface similar to Bash, supporting key functionalities like command execution, input/output redirection, piping, and background processing. It also includes **custom commands** such as:
- `sb`: Detects potential malware processes based on CPU heuristics.
- `delep`: Unlocks and forcefully deletes files currently in use.

The project is built using C++ and uses the Linux `/proc` file system and system calls to interact with processes and files.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Command Execution**: Supports internal and external command execution.
- **I/O Redirection & Piping**: Handles `<`, `>`, `|`, etc.
- **Background Execution**: Use `&` to run processes in the background.
- **Command History**: Integrated via GNU Readline.
- **Arrow Key Navigation**: Use up/down arrows to scroll through history.
- **Malware Detection (sb)**: Identifies idle parent processes with high child CPU usage.
- **File Deletion Utility (delep)**: Force-deletes locked or in-use files.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayushmohta7/custom-shell.git
cd custom-shell
```

### Build the shell:
```bash
make
```

Ensure you have a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) and `make` installed.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Run the shell:
```bash
./shell
```

You'll be presented with a prompt where you can execute shell commands and use custom utilities.

## üõ† Built-in Commands

### 1. `sb` ‚Äì SquashBug (Malware Detector)
Detects potential malware-like behavior using the following heuristic:
- If a sleeping parent process spawns many child processes that consume high CPU collectively, it is flagged as suspicious.
- CPU usage is calculated using `/proc/[pid]/stat`.
- Child hierarchy from `/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]/children`.

### 2. `delep` ‚Äì Delete Locked Files
Unlocks and forcefully deletes a file even if it's in use by another process:
```bash
delep <filename>
```
